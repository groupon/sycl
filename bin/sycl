#$USAGE

#$ME is a command line utility to run Ruby code on one or more YAML files.
It is similar to awk, but instead of processing lines of a file, it reads
full files as YAML; and instead of using awk language, you write Ruby code
which works with the data parsed from YAML.

The required first argument is a literal Ruby program. When this code is
run, the following variables are available:

    f    filename of the file being parsed
    y    the YAML text that was parsed
    d    data parsed from interpreting YAML

The d variable is a Sycl object (https://github.com/groupon/sycl)
This lets you access hashes with dot notation (for example, the lookup
d['foo']['bar'] can be written as d.foo.bar), including safe variants
with get() and set() methods (d.get('foo.bar') returns nil instead of
dying if d['foo'] does not exist). YAML output is sorted.

Options:
    -h, --help       display this help text and exit
    -i, --inplace    overwrite YAML files in place if d is modified
    -y, --yaml       output return value of program as YAML

Examples:
    sycl 'puts "\#{d.hostname} \#{d.interfaces.eth0.inet[0]}"' host*.yml
    sycl -i 'd.params.ntp_servers = %w{ns1 ns2}' host2.yml
    sycl -y d unsorted.yml > sorted.yml
